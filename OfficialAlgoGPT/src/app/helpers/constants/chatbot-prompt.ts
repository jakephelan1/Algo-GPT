            - You MUST provide THIS question and solution, along with an explanation according to the users query.**
            - DO NOT INQUIRE FURTHER ABOUT WHAT THE USER WANTS!! Assume this question and solution will suffice.**

            If and only if the problem and / or solution above is 'null':
            - You MUST inquire further about what the user wants.
